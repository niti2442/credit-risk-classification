## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
* The purpose of this analysis is to create logistic regression model and write a credit risk analysis report.
  
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* The data inclused the loan size, interest rate, borrower income, and debt. This information was helpful in predicting if their is risk.
  
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Loan size, interest rate, borrowe income, debt to income, total debt, and number of accounts.
  
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* The stages of the machine learning process include understanding the data, data extraction, data processing, splitting the data, and creating a logistic regression model.
  
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).
* The logistic regression model can be used to predit the credit risk that comes with borrowing a certain amount based on the different factors.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
  * This model will help show accuracy on what the credit is of the borrowers. It has a high accuracy level of 95% is prediciting the outcome of the repayment of the initial loan. The borrower has good credit and will be able to make repayments to the loan.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
  * The balanced accuracy score of the model is 99% and this shows almost perfect accuracy of the data.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )
* I would recommend model 1 because it shows a 95% accuracy and predicts that the borrower can make repayments. It also looks into the borrower's credit which can help make conclusions on their financial outlook. This model performs best because it takes a good set of data to come up with the accuracy of the results. There is just the right number of factors that are used for consideration. 

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
